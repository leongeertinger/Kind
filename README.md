# Kind Gesture Generator

This is a simple generator that generates kind gestures for you.
I made this quick project to teach myself how to use the basics of git.

## Main flow

The main flow of the application is as follows:

1. Display the main menu through runApp().
2. Let the user choose their option.
3. Based on choice the program will either generate a gesture or exit.

## Learnings

- Core git workflow (still working on using branches)
- New concepts as creating a readline function to handle user input.
- process.exit().

## Future improvements

- Add testing
- Add security measures
- Add more gestures
- Add more options
